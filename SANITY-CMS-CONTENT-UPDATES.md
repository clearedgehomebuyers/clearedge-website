### 1. Foreclosure (`/situations/foreclosure`)

**Field: `metaTitle`**
```
Sell Your House to Avoid Foreclosure in PA | ClearEdge
```
*(55 chars — "foreclosure" + "PA" + brand)*

**Field: `metaDescription`**
```
Behind on mortgage payments in Pennsylvania? Sell your house before sheriff sale and walk away with cash. ClearEdge closes in 7 days — fast enough to stop foreclosure. No fees.
```
*(155 chars — urgency, specific timeline, proof point)*

**Field: `heroHeadline`**
```
You Have More Options Than the Bank Wants You to Know.
```

**Field: `heroSubheadline`**
```
If you're behind on payments and the letters keep coming, you don't have to lose your home to the bank. ClearEdge can close fast enough to stop the foreclosure, satisfy your lender, and put cash in your hands — not theirs.
```

**Field: `problemDescription`** (PortableText — enter as 4 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Here's what no one tells you about foreclosure in Pennsylvania: you have more time and more options than the bank's letters imply. PA's judicial foreclosure process is one of the longest in the country — from the first missed payment to sheriff sale typically takes 12–18 months. That sounds like a lot of time, but most homeowners spend it paralyzed by shame, stress, and conflicting advice. By the time they take action, the window has shrunk to weeks.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Under Pennsylvania's Act 91, your lender is required to send you a formal notice before filing foreclosure and give you at least 30 days to explore alternatives — including selling the property. This is your legal right, and it's the window ClearEdge uses most often to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. We can close in as little as 7 days once you accept our offer, and we coordinate directly with your lender to ensure the payoff satisfies the debt.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
The financial damage of foreclosure extends far beyond losing your home. A foreclosure on your credit report stays for 7 years, drops your score by 100–150 points, and makes it difficult to rent, buy another home, or even get certain jobs. Some PA counties also pursue deficiency judgments — meaning the bank can come after you for the difference between what your home sells for at sheriff sale and what you owe. Selling before the sale eliminates this risk entirely.
```

Paragraph 4:
```
Every week you wait, the situation gets harder to resolve. Interest and penalties accrue, your lender becomes less willing to negotiate, and the sheriff sale date gets closer. If you're receiving Act 91 notices, pre-foreclosure letters, or your mortgage servicer is calling about missed payments, contact ClearEdge now. Tyler personally reviews every foreclosure situation and can give you an honest assessment of your options within 24 hours — even if selling to us isn't the best one.
```

**Field: `benefits`** (array of 4 objects)

Benefit 1:
- title: `Close Before Sheriff Sale`
- description: `We can close in as little as 7 days — often fast enough to stop the foreclosure process entirely. Your lender gets their payoff, the foreclosure stops, and your credit is protected.`

Benefit 2:
- title: `Walk Away With Cash`
- description: `Instead of losing everything at sheriff sale, you keep whatever equity remains after the mortgage payoff. Most PA homeowners in pre-foreclosure still have significant equity — don't let the bank take it.`

Benefit 3:
- title: `No Repairs, No Cleaning`
- description: `When you're behind on mortgage payments, the last thing you should spend money on is fixing up the house. We buy it exactly as it sits today — leave everything, fix nothing.`

Benefit 4:
- title: `Protect Your Credit Score`
- description: `A completed foreclosure drops your credit score 100–150 points and stays on your report for 7 years. Selling before the sale shows as a standard home sale — no foreclosure on your record.`

**Field: `faqs`** (array of 5 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `How fast can ClearEdge close to stop my foreclosure?`
- answer: `We can close in as little as 7 days when the title is clear. For most pre-foreclosure situations, we close within 14–21 days. We coordinate directly with your lender to ensure the payoff satisfies the debt and the foreclosure is dismissed. The key is contacting us as early as possible — the more time we have before your sheriff sale date, the more options we can offer.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Will I owe money after selling if I'm behind on payments?`
- answer: `In most cases, no. If you have equity in your home (your home is worth more than what you owe), we pay off your mortgage from the sale proceeds and you keep the difference. If you owe more than the home is worth, we can discuss a short sale with your lender — but this requires lender approval and takes longer.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `What if I've already received a sheriff sale notice?`
- answer: `You can still sell — but time is critical. In Pennsylvania, you have the right to sell your property up until the sheriff sale is completed. We've closed transactions with as little as 10 days before the scheduled sale date. Call Tyler immediately at (610) 904-8526 if your sale date is approaching.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `Does selling to ClearEdge affect my credit differently than foreclosure?`
- answer: `Yes — significantly. A foreclosure stays on your credit report for 7 years and drops your score 100–150 points. Selling to ClearEdge shows as a standard property sale on your credit report. There's no foreclosure mark, no deficiency judgment risk, and you can qualify for a new mortgage in as little as 2 years instead of 7.`

FAQ 5:
- question: `What happens if I just ignore the foreclosure letters?`
- answer: `The process continues without you. In Pennsylvania, after the Act 91 notice period, your lender files a complaint, then applies for summary judgment, then schedules a sheriff sale. You lose all equity in the home, your credit is severely damaged, and the lender may pursue a deficiency judgment for any remaining balance. The sooner you explore your options, the more options you'll have.`

### 2. Inherited Property (`/situations/inherited-property`)

**Field: `metaTitle`**
```
Sell an Inherited House in PA — No Repairs, No Probate Delays | ClearEdge
```
*(60 chars)*

**Field: `metaDescription`**
```
Inherited a house in Pennsylvania? ClearEdge buys inherited properties as-is during or after probate. No cleanout, no repairs. Tyler handles everything. Fair cash offer in 24 hours.
```
*(155 chars)*

**Field: `heroHeadline`**
```
You Inherited a House. You Don't Have to Inherit the Stress.
```

**Field: `heroSubheadline`**
```
Dealing with a loved one's property is emotionally exhausting — especially when it needs work, has decades of belongings, or is hours away. ClearEdge buys inherited houses exactly as they are. We handle the hard part so you can focus on what matters.
```

**Field: `problemDescription`** (PortableText — 4 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Inheriting a house in Pennsylvania is supposed to feel like a gift. Instead, most people describe it as one of the most stressful experiences of their lives. You're grieving, navigating a legal process you've never dealt with before, and suddenly responsible for a property that may be in another city, full of decades of belongings, and in need of significant repairs. The traditional advice — "clean it out, fix it up, list it with an agent" — assumes you have the time, money, and emotional bandwidth to manage a months-long renovation project. Most people don't.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
The probate process in Pennsylvania adds another layer of complexity. If the property was solely in the deceased's name, you typically need Letters Testamentary (if there's a will) or Letters of Administration (if there's no will) from the Register of Wills before you can legally sell. This process takes 2–6 weeks in most PA counties. If the property passed outside probate — via a joint deed with rights of survivorship, a living trust, or a transfer-on-death deed — you may be able to sell immediately. ClearEdge works with estate attorneys across Lackawanna, Luzerne, Lehigh, Northampton, and Monroe counties regularly, and we can help you determine which path applies.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
While you wait, the property costs money. Mortgage payments (if any), property taxes, homeowner's insurance, utilities to prevent pipe freezing, and lawn maintenance add up to $1,000–$2,500 per month. If the property is vacant, you're also at risk for vandalism, squatters, and code violations — especially in municipalities like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre where vacant property enforcement has increased. Every month you delay the sale is money out of the estate.
```

Paragraph 4:
```
ClearEdge buys inherited properties in any condition — hoarder situations, deferred maintenance, fire damage, outdated systems, even properties with active code violations. You don't need to clean it out, repair it, or even visit. Tyler personally handles every inherited property purchase and can work directly with your estate attorney to close once the legal authority is in place. If you haven't started probate yet, we can refer you to local attorneys who handle it efficiently and affordably.
```

**Field: `benefits`** (4 objects)

Benefit 1:
- title: `Buy 100% As-Is — Including Contents`
- description: `Leave everything behind — furniture, clothing, personal items, junk. We handle the complete cleanout after closing at no cost to you. No need to rent dumpsters, hire cleanout crews, or spend weekends sorting through belongings.`

Benefit 2:
- title: `Close During or After Probate`
- description: `We work with estate attorneys across Eastern PA and can close as soon as you have legal authority to sell. Whether you have Letters Testamentary, a living trust, or a survivorship deed, we know the process.`

Benefit 3:
- title: `Handle Multi-Heir Situations`
- description: `When multiple siblings or family members inherit a property, disagreements about what to do can drag on for months. A cash sale gives everyone a clean split of the proceeds — no ongoing property management disputes.`

Benefit 4:
- title: `Out-of-State? We Handle Everything`
- description: `Many inherited properties are hours away from where the heirs live. Tyler handles the walkthrough, coordinates with the title company, and arranges mobile notary for remote closings. You don't need to visit the property.`

**Field: `faqs`** (5 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Do I need to go through probate before I can sell an inherited house in PA?`
- answer: `It depends on how the property was titled. If the deceased was the sole owner, yes — you'll need Letters Testamentary or Letters of Administration from the Register of Wills before you can legally sell. This takes 2–6 weeks in most PA counties. If the property was held jointly with rights of survivorship, in a living trust, or had a transfer-on-death deed, you may be able to sell without probate. ClearEdge can help you determine which path applies.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Can I sell an inherited house without cleaning it out first?`
- answer: `Yes. ClearEdge buys inherited properties exactly as they are — contents and all. Leave the furniture, personal items, junk, everything. We handle the complete cleanout after closing at no cost to you. This is especially important for families dealing with hoarding situations or homes with decades of accumulated belongings.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `How much does it cost to maintain an inherited house while waiting to sell?`
- answer: `The typical carrying cost for an inherited property in Eastern PA is $1,000–$2,500 per month — including property taxes, insurance, utilities (even if vacant, you need heat to prevent frozen pipes), and basic maintenance. If there's still a mortgage, add the monthly payment. Every month you delay the sale is money coming out of the estate's value.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `What if multiple siblings inherited the house and we disagree on what to do?`
- answer: `This is one of the most common situations we see. When multiple heirs inherit a property, all parties with legal authority must agree to sell. A cash sale simplifies this — there's a clear offer, a quick closing, and the proceeds are split according to the will or PA intestate law. No one gets stuck managing the property long-term, and no one has to buy out the others at an uncertain value.`

FAQ 5:
- question: `Do I have to pay inheritance tax before selling in Pennsylvania?`
- answer: `Pennsylvania inheritance tax is due within 9 months of the date of death, but you don't have to pay it before selling. In fact, selling the property can provide the cash needed to pay the tax. PA inheritance tax rates are: 0% for surviving spouses, 4.5% for direct descendants (children, grandchildren), 12% for siblings, and 15% for other beneficiaries. The REU-500 tax waiver may be required by the title company at closing.`

### 3. Divorce (`/situations/divorce`)

**Field: `metaTitle`**
```
Sell Your House Fast During Divorce in PA | ClearEdge
```
*(52 chars)*

**Field: `metaDescription`**
```
Selling your house during a PA divorce? ClearEdge buys the marital home for cash in 7–14 days. Fair split, no showings, no delays. Both parties move on faster.
```
*(150 chars)*

**Field: `heroHeadline`**
```
The House Doesn't Have to Be the Hardest Part of Your Divorce.
```

**Field: `heroSubheadline`**
```
When you're going through a divorce, the marital home becomes the biggest obstacle to moving on. A quick cash sale eliminates months of showings, arguments about repairs, and uncertainty — so both parties can close this chapter and start fresh.
```

**Field: `problemDescription`** (PortableText — 4 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Selling a house during a divorce in Pennsylvania is emotionally and legally complicated. The marital home is usually the largest shared asset, and it becomes the focal point of disagreements about repairs, listing price, agent selection, showing schedules, and how to split the proceeds. These disagreements extend the divorce timeline, increase attorney fees, and keep both parties financially and emotionally tied to each other longer than necessary.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
The traditional listing process makes things worse. Listing with an agent means 60–90 days on market (minimum), during which one or both parties may still be living in the home, paying the mortgage, and managing showings. In Pennsylvania, if the divorce isn't finalized yet, both spouses must agree on and sign any listing agreement and sales contract. If one party is uncooperative or slow to respond, the process stalls. Meanwhile, mortgage payments, property taxes, and insurance keep draining both parties' finances.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
Pennsylvania is an equitable distribution state — which doesn't mean 50/50. It means the court divides marital property "fairly" based on factors like length of marriage, each spouse's income, and contributions to the property. A cash sale simplifies this significantly: there's a clear sale price, the mortgage and closing costs are paid, and the remaining proceeds are split according to your separation agreement or court order. No ambiguity, no disagreements about market value, no months of waiting.
```

Paragraph 4:
```
ClearEdge has purchased dozens of homes from divorcing couples across Eastern PA. Tyler works with both parties (and their attorneys) to ensure the process is fair, transparent, and as fast as possible. Both spouses sign the purchase agreement, the title company handles the closing, and proceeds are distributed according to your agreement. Most divorce sales close within 14 days — eliminating the marital home as a source of ongoing conflict.
```

**Field: `benefits`** (4 objects)

Benefit 1:
- title: `Close in 14 Days — Not 90`
- description: `A traditional listing during divorce means months of coordinating schedules, negotiating repairs, and hoping buyer financing doesn't fall through. We close in 14 days so both parties can finalize the divorce faster.`

Benefit 2:
- title: `Clean, Fair Split of Proceeds`
- description: `The sale price is clear, the proceeds are wired to the title company, and the split follows your separation agreement or court order. No arguments about market value, no disputes about repair credits.`

Benefit 3:
- title: `No Showings, No Strangers`
- description: `If one or both spouses still live in the home, showings add stress to an already difficult situation. With ClearEdge, there are no open houses, no weekend showings, and no staging. Tyler visits once, makes an offer, and you're done.`

Benefit 4:
- title: `Both Attorneys Stay Informed`
- description: `Tyler works directly with both parties' attorneys to ensure the sale is handled properly within the divorce proceedings. Both sides review and approve the purchase agreement before closing.`

**Field: `faqs`** (5 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Do both spouses have to agree to sell during a divorce in PA?`
- answer: `Generally yes — if both names are on the deed, both must agree to sell and sign the purchase agreement. If one spouse won't agree, the other can petition the court to order the sale. In some cases, the divorce settlement itself orders the sale of the marital home. ClearEdge works with both parties and their attorneys to facilitate the process.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Can I sell the house before the divorce is finalized?`
- answer: `Yes. You can sell the marital home before the divorce is finalized as long as both spouses agree (or the court orders it). The proceeds are typically held in escrow or distributed according to a temporary agreement until the divorce settlement is finalized. Selling early actually simplifies the divorce by removing the largest shared asset from negotiations.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `How are the sale proceeds split in a PA divorce?`
- answer: `Pennsylvania follows equitable distribution — not necessarily 50/50. The split is determined by your separation agreement, mediated settlement, or court order. ClearEdge doesn't determine how proceeds are divided; we sell the property and the title company distributes funds according to the legal agreement between the parties.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `What if my spouse is uncooperative about selling?`
- answer: `If your spouse won't agree to sell and it's preventing the divorce from moving forward, your attorney can petition the court for a partition sale or include the sale as part of the divorce order. Once a court order is in place, ClearEdge can proceed with the purchase. Talk to your divorce attorney about your specific options.`

FAQ 5:
- question: `Can we sell if one spouse already moved out?`
- answer: `Yes — this is actually one of the most common divorce sale scenarios we handle. The spouse who moved out can sign documents remotely through a mobile notary. Both parties don't need to be present at closing simultaneously. Tyler coordinates the logistics so neither party is inconvenienced.`

Relocating for work and need to sell your PA house fast? ClearEdge closes in 7–14 days to match your start date. No double mortgage payments. Fair cash offer in 24 hours.

Your New Job Shouldn't Wait for Your Old House to Sell.
```

**Field: `heroSubheadline`**
```
When your employer gives you a start date, you don't have 90 days to list, show, negotiate, and pray a buyer's financing doesn't fall through. ClearEdge closes on your timeline — even if that's 7 days from now.
```

**Field: `problemDescription`** (PortableText — 3 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Job relocation is exciting — until you realize you need to sell your current home before you can buy or rent in your new city. The traditional listing process takes 90–180 days in Pennsylvania when you factor in prep, listing, showings, negotiations, inspections, and closing. If your employer wants you started in 30 days, the math simply doesn't work. Many relocating homeowners end up paying two mortgages simultaneously — their old home and their new one — costing an extra $2,000–$4,000 per month while the old house sits on the market.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Some employers offer relocation buyout programs or relocation assistance, but many don't — especially for mid-career moves, lateral transfers, or roles at smaller companies. Even when relocation assistance exists, it typically covers moving costs, not the cost of carrying two homes. And if your current home needs repairs to list traditionally, you're looking at spending $10,000–$30,000+ before you can even put it on the market — money that should be going toward your fresh start, not your old one.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
ClearEdge offers a guaranteed cash offer that closes on your timeline. Whether you need to close before your start date, want to match your lease start in your new city, or simply need the equity freed up to make your move — we make it work. No repairs, no showings, no months of uncertainty. Tyler personally works with relocating homeowners to coordinate closing dates that align with their move, and many of our relocation sales close within 14 days.
```

**Field: `benefits`** (4 objects)

Benefit 1:
- title: `Close Before Your Start Date`
- description: `We match your timeline. If you need to close in 7 days, we close in 7 days. If you need 30 days to coordinate your move, that works too. You choose the closing date — we make it happen.`

Benefit 2:
- title: `Stop Paying Two Mortgages`
- description: `Every month your old house sits on the market is $2,000–$4,000+ in double mortgage payments, double insurance, double utilities. A quick cash sale stops the financial bleeding so you can focus your resources on your new life.`

Benefit 3:
- title: `No Flying Back for Showings`
- description: `Once you've relocated, managing a listing from another city is a nightmare — coordinating showings, dealing with agents remotely, flying back for repairs. We visit once, make an offer, and handle everything from there.`

Benefit 4:
- title: `Sell As-Is — No Pre-Move Repairs`
- description: `The last thing you need while packing up your life is a $20K repair project to make the house "list-ready." We buy your home in its current condition — no repairs, no staging, no professional cleaning.`

**Field: `faqs`** (4 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `How fast can ClearEdge close for a job relocation?`
- answer: `We can close in as little as 7 days when the title is clear. Most relocation sales close within 14 days. We specifically coordinate closing dates to match your employer's start date or your lease start in your new city — so you're not caught paying two mortgages.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `My employer offers a relocation buyout — should I take it or sell to ClearEdge?`
- answer: `Take the employer buyout if it's offered — it's usually the best option because the company guarantees the purchase at a set price. If your employer doesn't offer a buyout, or if the buyout is below what you'd accept, ClearEdge is your fastest alternative. We can provide a competing cash offer within 24 hours so you can compare.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `Can I sell before I've found a place in my new city?`
- answer: `Yes. We can build flexibility into the closing timeline. If you need to close quickly to free up cash for your new home's down payment, we can close in 7 days. If you want to stay in the house while you finalize housing in your new city, we can set a closing date 30–60 days out. You're in control of the timeline.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `What if my house needs work and I don't have time to fix it before moving?`
- answer: `That's exactly the situation we specialize in. Most relocating homeowners don't have weeks to spare for contractors. We buy your home exactly as it is — outdated kitchens, deferred maintenance, cluttered basements, whatever. No repairs, no cleaning. Just pack your personal belongings and go.`

```
Spending $20,000–$50,000 on repairs to list traditionally is a gamble — and you might not get that money back. ClearEdge buys houses in any condition, in any state of disrepair. No repairs, no inspections, no contingencies.
```

**Field: `problemDescription`** (PortableText — 4 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Eastern Pennsylvania's housing stock is among the oldest in the country. Most homes in Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Allentown, and Bethlehem were built before 1960 — and many before 1920. That means sellers regularly face expensive issues that didn't exist when these homes were built: knob-and-tube wiring that no insurer will cover, lead paint that requires certified abatement, asbestos in basement pipes and floor tiles, galvanized plumbing that's corroded from the inside, and foundations that have been settling for a century.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
The traditional advice is "fix it before you sell." But here's the problem with that advice: the repairs needed on a pre-1960 Pennsylvania home often cost $20,000–$50,000+. A foundation repair alone can run $10,000–$30,000. A roof replacement: $8,000–$15,000. Electrical rewiring: $10,000–$20,000. And even after you spend all that money, there's no guarantee the inspector won't find more problems, the buyer's financing won't fall through, or the home will sell for enough to recoup your investment. You're spending money you may never see again.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
The bigger problem is that many of these repair issues make traditional financing impossible. FHA and conventional lenders have minimum property standards — if the home fails the appraisal due to health, safety, or structural issues, the buyer's loan gets denied. This means the only buyers who CAN purchase your home are cash buyers. So you'd be spending $30,000–$50,000 on repairs to attract buyers who don't need financing... the same buyers who would have purchased it as-is without the repairs.
```

Paragraph 4:
```
ClearEdge has purchased homes with every type of repair issue you can imagine — foundation failures, fire damage, collapsed roofs, active mold infestations, hoarder situations, homes without working plumbing, properties that haven't been maintained in decades. We factor the repair costs into our offer, handle all renovations after closing, and you walk away without spending a dollar on contractors. Tyler personally assesses every property and explains exactly how the repair costs affect the offer.
```

**Field: `benefits`** (4 objects)

Benefit 1:
- title: `Buy Homes in Any Condition`
- description: `Foundation cracks, roof damage, mold, fire damage, knob-and-tube wiring, lead paint, asbestos, no working HVAC — none of it stops us from making a fair offer. We've truly seen it all.`

Benefit 2:
- title: `No Inspection Contingencies`
- description: `Traditional buyers send inspectors who find problems and demand $10,000–$20,000 in credits. Our offer is final — no renegotiating after a walk-through, no surprise deductions at closing.`

Benefit 3:
- title: `Skip the $20K–$50K Repair Bill`
- description: `Why spend your own money on a house you're selling? We factor repair costs into our offer so you don't pay anything out of pocket. For homes that need major work, homeowners often net more with us after factoring in the true cost of repairs, commissions, and carrying costs.`

Benefit 4:
- title: `Transparent Repair-Adjusted Offers`
- description: `Tyler walks through every property, estimates repair costs, and shows you exactly how the offer was calculated. No mystery pricing, no lowball tricks — just honest math based on the property's actual condition and local market values.`

**Field: `faqs`** (5 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `What types of repair issues does ClearEdge buy houses with?`
- answer: `Everything. Foundation cracks and settling, bowing basement walls, roof damage and leaks, active mold and water damage, fire and smoke damage, knob-and-tube wiring, lead paint, asbestos, outdated plumbing (galvanized or polybutylene), termite damage, hoarder situations, no working HVAC, and more. If it's a house, we'll make an offer on it.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Will I get a lower offer because my house needs repairs?`
- answer: `Yes — our offer reflects the property's current condition, not what it would be worth after $30,000 in renovations. But here's the key comparison: if you spend $30,000 on repairs, then pay a 5–6% agent commission and 2–4% closing costs on a higher sale price, your net proceeds are often very close to what we'd offer — minus the 3–6 months of hassle, risk, and carrying costs.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `My house has foundation issues — can it even be sold?`
- answer: `Yes. Pennsylvania law allows you to sell a home in any condition. You must disclose known structural defects on the Seller's Disclosure form, but you're not required to repair them. The challenge is that most mortgage lenders won't approve loans on homes with structural issues — which means traditional buyers can't purchase it. Cash buyers like ClearEdge don't have this limitation.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `Do I need to get repair estimates before selling to ClearEdge?`
- answer: `No. Tyler personally evaluates every property and estimates repair costs based on our experience renovating 200+ homes across Eastern PA. You don't need to hire contractors, get quotes, or spend money on inspections. We handle all of that assessment ourselves.`

FAQ 5:
- question: `What if my house has multiple major issues — not just one?`
- answer: `That's actually our sweet spot. A house that needs just a new roof might be worth listing traditionally. But a house that needs a roof, foundation work, electrical rewiring, AND plumbing replacement? That's where a cash sale makes the most financial sense. The more work a home needs, the less competitive the traditional market becomes — and the more value ClearEdge provides.`

The fines keep growing, the letters keep coming, and the problem feels impossible. ClearEdge buys properties with tax liens, code violations, and municipal debt across Eastern PA. The liens get paid at closing, the violations transfer to us, and you walk away clean.
```

**Field: `problemDescription`** (PortableText — 4 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
If you own a property with back taxes or code violations in Pennsylvania, you know the feeling: every month, the balance grows. Property tax penalties in PA accrue at 10% per year plus interest. Municipal code violation fines — especially in cities like Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Allentown, and Hazleton — can reach $100–$500 per day. Water and sewer liens accumulate automatically. And the longer you wait, the closer you get to a tax sale that could take the property entirely.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Code enforcement has intensified across Eastern PA in recent years. Scranton's L&I department has expanded its inspection program. Wilkes-Barre aggressively enforces its property maintenance code. Allentown requires a mandatory 5-day pre-sale inspection. Hazleton requires occupancy permits before tenants can move in. Bethlehem enforces the International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC/Article 1733) with escalating daily fines. For property owners who can't afford the required repairs, these violations feel like a death spiral — you can't afford to fix the property, you can't sell it through traditional channels because of the violations, and every day you hold it costs more.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
Most traditional buyers — and their lenders — won't touch a property with open code violations or significant tax liens. The title can't clear with outstanding liens, and buyers don't want the liability of inheriting violations. This leaves you stuck: you need to sell to resolve the financial burden, but the financial burden prevents you from selling traditionally.
```

Paragraph 4:
```
ClearEdge breaks that cycle. We purchase properties with tax liens, code violations, and municipal debt regularly throughout Eastern PA. Here's how it works: tax liens and municipal debts are paid from the sale proceeds at closing through the title company — you don't pay anything upfront. Code violations transfer to us as the new owner, and we handle the remediation after closing. You walk away with a clear title, no outstanding obligations, and cash in hand.
```

**Field: `benefits`** (4 objects)

Benefit 1:
- title: `Liens Paid From Sale Proceeds`
- description: `Back property taxes, water/sewer liens, and municipal debts are settled at closing through the title company. You don't need to come up with the money upfront — it comes from the sale price.`

Benefit 2:
- title: `Code Violations Transfer to Us`
- description: `Open L&I violations, IPMC violations, and code enforcement orders transfer with the property. We take on the responsibility of bringing the property into compliance after closing.`

Benefit 3:
- title: `Stop the Daily Fines Now`
- description: `Every day you wait, the fines grow. A quick cash sale — as fast as 7 days — stops the accumulation of penalties and prevents the situation from getting worse.`

Benefit 4:
- title: `Avoid Tax Sale or Sheriff Sale`
- description: `In Pennsylvania, delinquent property taxes lead to upset tax sale (after 2 years delinquent) and then judicial sale. Selling before the sale date lets you keep your equity instead of losing the property at auction.`

**Field: `faqs`** (5 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Can I sell my house if I owe back property taxes in Pennsylvania?`
- answer: `Yes. Back property taxes create a lien on the property, but the lien gets paid from the sale proceeds at closing. The title company handles the payoff directly with the county tax claim bureau. You don't need to pay the taxes before selling — the sale itself resolves the debt. Just make sure to sell before a scheduled tax sale date.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `What happens to code violations when I sell to ClearEdge?`
- answer: `The code violations transfer to ClearEdge as the new property owner. We take on the responsibility of making the required repairs and bringing the property into compliance with the local municipality. You are released from all violation-related obligations at closing.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `How close to a tax sale date can ClearEdge still buy my property?`
- answer: `We've purchased properties with as little as 2–3 weeks before the scheduled tax sale. The key factor is how quickly the title company can process the transaction. Call Tyler as soon as possible — the more time we have, the more options we have to structure the sale.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `What if the liens are more than the property is worth?`
- answer: `If the total liens exceed the property's market value, a traditional sale won't work because there wouldn't be enough proceeds to cover the debts. In this situation, you may need to negotiate with lien holders or explore other options. Tyler can assess your specific situation and give you an honest answer about whether a sale makes financial sense.`

FAQ 5:
- question: `Will code violations show up on my record after I sell?`
- answer: `Once the property transfers to the new owner, the violation responsibility transfers too. You are no longer the responsible party. However, any fines that accrued before the sale may still be your responsibility depending on the municipality — this is typically resolved at closing through the title company.`

```
Sell Your Rental Property for Cash in PA | ClearEdge
```
*(51 chars)*

**Field: `metaDescription`**
```
Done being a landlord in PA? ClearEdge buys rental properties with tenants in place — no eviction needed. Stop the midnight calls and liability. Fair cash offer in 24 hours.
```
*(154 chars)*

**Field: `heroHeadline`**
```
Being a Landlord Wasn't Supposed to Feel Like a Second Job.
```

**Field: `heroSubheadline`**
```
Late rent, midnight maintenance calls, tenant damage, and the constant liability of someone else living in your property. If the ROI no longer justifies the headaches, ClearEdge buys rental properties with tenants in place. No eviction. No repairs. Just freedom.
```

**Field: `problemDescription`** (PortableText — 4 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
You bought the rental property because someone told you it was "passive income." But there's nothing passive about chasing late rent, coordinating emergency plumber visits at 2 AM, dealing with tenant complaints, navigating PA landlord-tenant law, and worrying about whether your tenants are damaging the property. The reality of being a landlord in Eastern Pennsylvania — with aging housing stock, increasing code enforcement, and rising maintenance costs — is that the ROI rarely matches the brochure.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
The problem compounds when you try to sell. Listing a tenant-occupied property traditionally is extremely difficult. Most buyers want vacant homes. Your tenants may not cooperate with showings — and in Pennsylvania, you must give reasonable notice (typically 24 hours) before entering the property. Tenants who know the property is for sale often stop paying rent, damage the property, or refuse to keep it clean for showings. And if your tenants are on a lease, the buyer inherits that lease — which shrinks your buyer pool to investors only.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
Evicting tenants before selling is an option, but it's expensive and slow. Pennsylvania's eviction process takes 2–4 months for non-payment and longer for lease violations. During that time, you're still paying the mortgage, taxes, and insurance — and the property may be getting damaged. Even after eviction, you're often left with a property that needs significant repairs before it can be listed.
```

Paragraph 4:
```
ClearEdge eliminates all of this. We buy rental properties with tenants in place — paying, non-paying, month-to-month, on a lease, Section 8, whatever the situation. You don't need to evict anyone, make repairs, or even tell your tenants (we handle the notification after closing). Tyler has purchased dozens of occupied rental properties and knows how to navigate the tenant situation smoothly and legally.
```

**Field: `benefits`** (4 objects)

Benefit 1:
- title: `Buy With Tenants in Place`
- description: `No eviction needed. Whether your tenants are current, behind on rent, month-to-month, on a lease, or Section 8 — we buy the property as-is and handle the tenant situation after closing.`

Benefit 2:
- title: `End the Liability Immediately`
- description: `Landlord liability in PA is real — slip and falls, habitability claims, lead paint exposure, code violations. Selling ends your exposure to lawsuits, fines, and the stress of being responsible for someone else's home.`

Benefit 3:
- title: `No Repairs on Tenant-Damaged Properties`
- description: `Tenant-occupied rentals often have significant wear and tear. We buy in any condition — holes in walls, damaged floors, broken appliances, deferred maintenance. You don't fix a thing.`

Benefit 4:
- title: `Keep Your Cash Flow Until Closing`
- description: `Continue collecting rent right up until the closing date. We don't require the property to be vacant, and you don't lose any rental income during the sale process.`

**Field: `faqs`** (5 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Do I need to evict my tenants before selling to ClearEdge?`
- answer: `No. We buy rental properties with tenants in place. Whether they're paying, non-paying, on a lease, month-to-month, or Section 8 — we handle the tenant situation after closing. You don't need to go through the PA eviction process, which can take 2–4 months and cost thousands in legal fees and lost rent.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Will ClearEdge buy a rental with problem tenants?`
- answer: `Yes. Problem tenants are one of the most common reasons landlords call us. Non-payment, property damage, lease violations, hoarding, unauthorized occupants — we've seen it all. We factor the tenant situation into our offer and handle everything after closing, including eviction if necessary.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `What happens to my tenants after I sell?`
- answer: `ClearEdge assumes the landlord role after closing. If tenants are on a lease, we honor it (as required by PA law). If they're month-to-month, we evaluate whether to continue the tenancy or provide proper notice to vacate. We always follow Pennsylvania landlord-tenant law and treat tenants respectfully.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `Can I sell a multi-family property (duplex, triplex) to ClearEdge?`
- answer: `Yes. We buy single-family rentals, duplexes, triplexes, and quads — with or without tenants. Multi-family properties with mixed occupancy (some units occupied, some vacant) are fine too. Tyler evaluates each unit separately and factors the overall rental situation into the offer.`

FAQ 5:
- question: `I'm an out-of-state landlord. Can you handle the sale remotely?`
- answer: `Absolutely — out-of-state landlords are one of our most common seller profiles. Managing a rental from another state is expensive and stressful. Tyler handles the property walkthrough, tenant communication, title company coordination, and closing logistics. You can sign documents remotely through a mobile notary and never need to visit the property.`

Sell a Vacant House in PA for Cash | ClearEdge

**Field: `metaDescription`**

Vacant house costing you $1,000–$2,000/month in PA? ClearEdge buys empty properties as-is for cash. Stop the taxes, insurance, and risk. Close in 7–14 days.

```
Every Month That House Sits Empty, It Costs You Money.
```

**Field: `heroSubheadline`**
```
Property taxes, insurance, utilities to prevent frozen pipes, lawn maintenance, vandalism risk, and code violation exposure — a vacant house in Pennsylvania doesn't just sit there, it bleeds money. ClearEdge buys empty homes fast so you can stop the drain.
```

**Field: `problemDescription`** (PortableText — 3 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
A vacant house in Eastern Pennsylvania is an expensive liability. Every month, you're paying property taxes, homeowner's insurance (which is typically higher for vacant properties), utilities to prevent pipe freezing in winter, and lawn maintenance to avoid code violations. In total, most PA homeowners spend $1,000–$2,500+ per month carrying a vacant property — and that's before anything goes wrong. A burst pipe in January, vandalism, or a squatter situation can add thousands in unexpected costs.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Municipalities across Eastern PA have also increased enforcement on vacant properties. Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, Allentown, and Hazleton all have vacant property registration requirements and accelerated code enforcement for empty homes. Tall grass, peeling paint, broken windows, and other maintenance issues that might go unnoticed on an occupied home attract immediate attention — and fines — on a vacant one. Some municipalities charge additional fees for vacant property registration on top of the standard penalties.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
The longer a house sits vacant, the harder it becomes to sell traditionally. Deferred maintenance accelerates without someone living in the home to catch problems early. Buyers and their inspectors are extra cautious with vacant homes, assuming the worst about hidden issues. And if the house has been empty for years, insurance becomes extremely difficult to obtain — some carriers won't cover homes that have been vacant for more than 60 days. ClearEdge breaks this cycle by buying vacant properties in any condition, as-is, with a closing timeline as short as 7 days.
```

**Field: `benefits`** (4 objects)

Benefit 1:
- title: `Stop the Monthly Cash Drain`
- description: `Taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance — a vacant house costs $1,000–$2,500+ every month. A quick cash sale stops every recurring expense immediately.`

Benefit 2:
- title: `Eliminate Vandalism and Liability Risk`
- description: `Vacant properties attract break-ins, squatters, and vandalism — and you're liable for injuries on your property. Selling removes the risk and the sleepless nights.`

Benefit 3:
- title: `No Cleaning, No Repairs`
- description: `Whether the house has been empty for 6 months or 6 years, we buy it as-is. No renovations, no cleanout, no bringing it up to code before selling.`

Benefit 4:
- title: `Avoid Municipal Fines`
- description: `Many PA municipalities have accelerated code enforcement for vacant properties — including mandatory registration, increased inspections, and daily fines for violations. Selling ends your exposure.`

**Field: `faqs`** (4 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `How much does it cost to maintain a vacant house in Pennsylvania?`
- answer: `The typical carrying cost for a vacant property in Eastern PA is $1,000–$2,500 per month. This includes property taxes, insurance (which costs more for vacant homes), utilities (you need heat to prevent frozen pipes), lawn maintenance, and basic upkeep to avoid code violations. If something goes wrong — burst pipe, vandalism, squatters — add thousands more.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `What if my vacant house has been empty for years?`
- answer: `We still buy it. Houses that have been vacant for years typically have more deferred maintenance — roof leaks, mold from moisture, animal damage, overgrown landscaping. None of this stops us from making an offer. Tyler assesses the property in its current state and makes a fair offer based on what it needs.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `Do I need to turn the utilities back on before selling?`
- answer: `No. We can evaluate the property without active utilities. However, if the water has been shut off for an extended period in a cold climate, there's a risk of frozen and burst pipes that we'll assess during our walkthrough. Either way, you don't need to spend money on utilities before selling to us.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `Can ClearEdge buy a vacant house that's in another state from where I live?`
- answer: `Yes — remote sales are common for vacant properties. Many owners live hours away and haven't visited the property in months or years. Tyler handles the walkthrough, coordinates with the title company, and arranges mobile notary for your signing. You never need to visit the property.`

### 9. Foundation & Structural Issues (`/situations/foundation-structural-issues`)

```
Sell a House With Foundation Problems in PA | ClearEdge

```
Foundation Problems Don't Have to Be Your Problem Anymore.
```

**Field: `heroSubheadline`**
```
Foundation repairs cost $10,000–$50,000+ and most mortgage lenders won't finance a home with structural issues. ClearEdge pays cash, closes in 14–30 days, and you don't fix a thing. We've been buying houses with foundation problems across Eastern PA since 2016.
```

**Field: `problemDescription`** (PortableText — 4 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Foundation and structural issues are among the most expensive and most deal-killing problems a Pennsylvania homeowner can face. A single foundation crack can cost $5,000–$15,000 to repair. Bowing basement walls requiring steel I-beam reinforcement or carbon fiber strapping can run $10,000–$25,000. Full foundation replacement — which some older PA homes need — starts at $30,000 and can exceed $50,000. And unlike a cosmetic issue, you can't hide structural damage from a buyer's inspector.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
The real problem isn't just the repair cost — it's that structural issues make traditional home sales nearly impossible. FHA, VA, and conventional mortgage lenders have strict property standards. If the appraisal or inspection identifies significant structural defects, the loan gets denied. This means the vast majority of homebuyers — the ones who need mortgage financing — cannot purchase your home. Your buyer pool shrinks to cash buyers and investors, regardless of how much you spend on marketing.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
In Eastern Pennsylvania, structural issues are especially common due to the region's geology and building history. Mine subsidence affects properties across Lackawanna and Luzerne counties where homes were built over former coal mines. Century-old stone and block foundations in cities like Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Allentown show their age through cracking, settling, and water infiltration. Homes in flood-prone areas near the Susquehanna River have experienced repeated water damage that compromises foundation integrity over time.
```

Paragraph 4:
```
Pennsylvania's Seller's Disclosure Law (68 Pa.C.S. § 7301-7315) requires you to disclose any known structural defects — including foundation cracks, settling, water infiltration, and prior repairs. But disclosure doesn't mean you have to repair them. ClearEdge buys houses with every type of structural issue: foundation cracks, bowing walls, settling and sinking, mine subsidence damage, water-damaged foundations, and more. Tyler personally evaluates every property, estimates the repair costs, and makes a fair offer based on the home's current condition.
```

**Field: `benefits`** (4 objects)

Benefit 1:
- title: `Buy Homes With Any Structural Issue`
- description: `Foundation cracks, bowing basement walls, settling, sinking floors, mine subsidence damage, water-damaged foundations — we buy them all as-is. No repair requirements.`

Benefit 2:
- title: `Cash Offer — No Lender Restrictions`
- description: `Mortgage lenders won't finance homes with structural defects. Because we pay cash, there's no appraisal requirement and no lender to deny the deal. If we make an offer, we close.`

Benefit 3:
- title: `Mine Subsidence Experience`
- description: `We've bought multiple properties in Lackawanna and Luzerne counties with mine subsidence damage — a problem unique to NEPA's coal region that most buyers won't touch.`

Benefit 4:
- title: `Transparent, Repair-Adjusted Pricing`
- description: `Tyler estimates foundation repair costs based on our experience renovating 200+ homes. We show you the math — what the home would be worth repaired minus estimated repair costs — so you understand exactly how the offer was calculated.`

**Field: `faqs`** (5 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `How much do foundation repairs cost in Pennsylvania?`
- answer: `Foundation repair costs vary widely based on the type and severity: minor crack sealing costs $500–$2,000, moderate crack repair with epoxy injection runs $2,000–$7,000, bowing wall reinforcement costs $5,000–$15,000 per wall, and full foundation replacement starts at $30,000+. In NEPA, mine subsidence repairs can exceed $50,000 depending on the extent of the damage.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Can a house with foundation problems pass a home inspection?`
- answer: `It depends on severity. Minor hairline cracks may pass, but significant structural defects — bowing walls, active settling, horizontal cracks, water infiltration — will fail any standard home inspection. More importantly, the buyer's mortgage lender will deny financing on homes with structural issues, regardless of the inspection. This is why cash buyers are often the only viable option for homes with foundation problems.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy houses with mine subsidence damage in NEPA?`
- answer: `Yes — and this is one of the most common structural issues we see in Lackawanna and Luzerne counties. Mine subsidence from the region's coal mining history causes foundation cracks, uneven floors, and structural instability that most buyers and their lenders won't touch. We buy these properties as-is and factor the subsidence repair costs into our offer.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `Do I have to disclose foundation issues when selling in PA?`
- answer: `Yes. Pennsylvania's Real Estate Seller Disclosure Law requires you to disclose any known material defects, including foundation and structural issues. You must note them on the standard PA Seller's Disclosure form. However, disclosure is not the same as repair — you're required to tell buyers about the problem, but you're not required to fix it before selling.`

FAQ 5:
- question: `What if I don't know the full extent of my foundation problems?`
- answer: `That's okay. You're only required to disclose what you know. Tyler will evaluate the property during his walkthrough and assess the structural situation. If we need a structural engineer's opinion, we arrange and pay for that assessment ourselves — you don't need to spend money on inspections or engineering reports before selling to us.`

```
Scranton is where ClearEdge started in 2016. We know every neighborhood — from the Hill Section to Green Ridge, Providence to West Side. Whether your home needs major work, you inherited a property, or you just want out fast, we'll make you a fair cash offer within 24 hours.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 4 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Scranton's housing market tells two very different stories. Move-in-ready homes in desirable neighborhoods like Green Ridge, Hill Section, and Minooka sell quickly and often above asking price. But homes that need work — and with an average home age of 80+ years, many do — face a completely different market. Knob-and-tube wiring, lead paint, aging foundations, and outdated plumbing scare off traditional buyers and their mortgage lenders. If your home falls into this second category, you could spend months on the market with no offers.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Scranton's L&I department has expanded its property inspection and code enforcement program in recent years, putting additional pressure on homeowners with deferred maintenance. Open violations prevent traditional sales and accumulate daily fines. Combined with Lackawanna County property taxes that can exceed $3,000–$5,000/year even on modest homes, the carrying costs of a problem property add up fast.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
Mine subsidence is another reality for parts of Scranton. The city sits atop former anthracite coal mines, and properties in certain neighborhoods face structural risks that traditional lenders simply won't finance. If your home has mine subsidence damage, foundation issues related to the region's mining history, or other structural concerns, the traditional buyer pool shrinks to almost zero.
```

Paragraph 4:
```
ClearEdge was founded in Scranton in 2016 — it's where Tyler bought his first investment property and where we've completed more transactions than any other market. We understand the neighborhood-by-neighborhood dynamics, the local code enforcement landscape, and the structural challenges unique to Lackawanna County. If you're trying to sell a Scranton home that the traditional market has overlooked, we can make you a fair cash offer within 24 hours.

```

**Field: `faqs`** (5 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy houses with mine subsidence damage in Scranton?`
- answer: `Yes — we're one of the few cash buyers in the region who will. Mine subsidence from Scranton's coal mining history causes foundation issues that mortgage lenders won't finance. We buy these properties as-is, factor the structural costs into our offer, and close without requiring any repairs.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `What Scranton neighborhoods does ClearEdge buy in?`
- answer: `Every one. We buy houses throughout Scranton — Green Ridge, Hill Section, West Side, South Side, Providence, North Scranton, Pine Brook, Minooka, Tripp Park, East Mountain, Plot Section, Keyser Valley, and everywhere in between. No neighborhood is off-limits.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `How fast can you close on a Scranton house?`
- answer: `We can close in as little as 7 days when the title is clear. Most Scranton transactions close within 14–21 days. If there are title complications like probate or tax liens, we handle the coordination and typically close within 30 days.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `My Scranton house has L&I violations. Can you still buy it?`
- answer: `Yes. We regularly buy Scranton properties with open L&I violations. The violations transfer to us at closing, we handle the remediation, and you walk away with no outstanding obligations to the city. This stops the daily fines from accumulating.`

FAQ 5:
- question: `I inherited a house in Scranton. Where do I start?`
- answer: `Start by determining how the property was titled — joint ownership, will, or no will. If probate is needed, the Lackawanna County Register of Wills handles it (typically 2–4 weeks to get Letters Testamentary). ClearEdge can close during or after probate and buys inherited houses 100% as-is — no cleanout, no repairs. Call Tyler at (610) 904-8526 for a free consultation.`

Cash Home Buyers in
```

**Field: `heroSubheadline`**
```
Wilkes-Barre's housing stock is aging, flood-zone properties face insurance challenges, and Luzerne County's code enforcement is getting stricter. If your home needs work you can't afford, ClearEdge buys Wilkes-Barre houses as-is — no repairs, no fees, fair cash offer within 24 hours.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 3 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Wilkes-Barre sits in the heart of the Wyoming Valley, and the city's housing market reflects decades of population decline followed by recent revitalization efforts. Move-in-ready homes near the downtown renaissance or in established neighborhoods like Heights and Parsons sell respectably. But the majority of Wilkes-Barre's housing stock — built in the early 1900s for coal industry workers — requires significant updates that cost more than many homeowners can justify.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Flood risk adds another layer of difficulty. Properties in FEMA-designated flood zones along the Susquehanna River face higher insurance costs, stricter lending requirements, and a smaller buyer pool. After the 2011 flooding, many properties were damaged and never fully repaired. If your property is in a flood zone — or was previously flood-damaged — traditional buyers often can't get financing. Luzerne County's code enforcement has also ramped up, with the city's property maintenance code carrying fines that escalate daily for unresolved violations.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
ClearEdge has been buying homes in Wilkes-Barre and throughout Luzerne County since 2016. We purchase properties in flood zones, with code violations, with structural issues, during probate, and with tenants in place. Tyler understands the local market dynamics — which neighborhoods are appreciating, where code enforcement is most active, and what realistic market values look like across the city.

```

**Field: `faqs`** (5 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy flood-zone properties in Wilkes-Barre?`
- answer: `Yes. Flood-zone properties along the Susquehanna River are difficult to sell traditionally because of insurance costs and lending restrictions. We pay cash — no mortgage, no lender requirements — so flood-zone designation doesn't affect our ability to purchase.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `How is the Wilkes-Barre housing market in 2026?`
- answer: `Downtown revitalization has boosted certain areas, but much of Wilkes-Barre's housing stock is 80–100 years old and needs significant work. Move-in-ready homes sell well; homes needing major updates sit on the market. For properties that aren't turnkey, a direct cash sale often nets more after factoring in repair costs, commissions, and carrying costs.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `Can you buy my Wilkes-Barre house if it has code violations?`
- answer: `Yes. Wilkes-Barre's property maintenance code enforcement has intensified, and violations carry daily fines. We buy properties with open violations regularly — the violations transfer to us at closing, we handle compliance, and you walk away clean.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `What areas of Luzerne County does ClearEdge serve?`
- answer: `We buy throughout Luzerne County — Wilkes-Barre, Hazleton, Pittston, Kingston, Nanticoke, West Pittston, Forty Fort, Wyoming, Swoyersville, Edwardsville, Plains, Plymouth, Ashley, and all surrounding areas.`

FAQ 5:
- question: `I inherited a house in Wilkes-Barre during a family flood zone. What are my options?`
- answer: `We buy inherited flood-zone properties regularly. You'll need Letters Testamentary from the Luzerne County Register of Wills before selling (if probate is required).

Hazleton's population growth has created demand — but the city's occupancy permit requirements and aging row-home stock make selling traditionally expensive and complicated. ClearEdge buys Hazleton properties as-is for cash. No occupancy permits, no repairs, no fees.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 3 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Hazleton has experienced significant population growth and demographic change over the past two decades, creating both opportunity and challenges for property owners. Demand for housing is strong, but the city's building stock — predominantly row homes and multi-family properties built in the early 1900s — often needs modernization that costs more than the properties are worth. Outdated electrical systems, lead paint, aging plumbing, and structural issues from decades of deferred maintenance are common.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Hazleton's occupancy permit requirement adds friction to any sale. The city requires a residential occupancy inspection before any new tenant moves in — checking smoke detectors, CO detectors, guardrails, GFCIs, egress windows, plumbing, and electrical safety. The $50 inspection fee is minor, but the required repairs to pass can cost thousands. For landlords selling tenant-occupied properties, this creates a catch-22: you can't sell to a traditional buyer who plans to rent without the property passing inspection, but you can't afford the repairs to pass.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
ClearEdge has been buying properties in Hazleton since 2016. We purchase row homes, single-families, and multi-family properties in any condition — and we handle occupancy permit issues after closing. Whether you're a tired landlord with multiple Hazleton rentals, an out-of-town owner who inherited a property, or a homeowner facing code violations, we can make a fair cash offer within 24 hours.

**Field: `faqs`** (4 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Does ClearEdge handle Hazleton's occupancy permit requirements?`
- answer: `Yes. Hazleton requires a residential occupancy inspection before new tenants move in. When we purchase your property, we handle all occupancy permit requirements after closing — you don't need to make any repairs or schedule any inspections before selling to us.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Can you buy a row home in Hazleton?`
- answer: `Yes. Row homes are the most common property type we buy in Hazleton. These properties often have shared walls, aging infrastructure, and small footprints that make expensive repairs even harder to justify. We buy row homes as-is in any condition.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `How fast can you close on a Hazleton property?`
- answer: `We can close in as little as 7 days when the title is clear. Most Hazleton transactions close within 14–21 days. If there are title complications or multiple lien payoffs needed, we coordinate everything and typically close within 30 days.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `I own multiple rental properties in Hazleton. Can you buy all of them?`
- answer: `Yes. We've purchased property portfolios from landlords exiting the Hazleton rental market. We can evaluate all properties together, make individual or bulk offers, and coordinate closings to match your timeline. Call Tyler to discuss your portfolio.`

```

**Field: `heroSubheadline`**
```
Pittston's river corridor location creates unique selling challenges — flood risk, aging infrastructure, and foundation concerns from the region's mining history. ClearEdge buys Pittston homes as-is for cash, regardless of condition or history.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Pittston sits along the Susquehanna River in Luzerne County, and the town's location creates selling challenges that most traditional buyers avoid. Properties near the river face flood zone designations, higher insurance costs, and stricter mortgage lending requirements. The borough's housing stock — much of it built in the coal boom era — shows its age through foundation settling, outdated systems, and deferred maintenance. Many homes along Main Street and the surrounding neighborhoods need significant updates that cost more than the traditional market will bear.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
For homeowners in Greater Pittston — including West Pittston, Dupont, Hughestown, and Avoca — selling to a cash buyer eliminates the complications that make traditional sales difficult. ClearEdge purchases properties with flood history, foundation concerns, code violations, and tenant issues throughout the Greater Pittston area. We factor these challenges into our offer so you don't have to spend money solving them first.

**Field: `faqs`** (3 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy flood-zone properties in Pittston?`
- answer: `Yes. River corridor properties in Pittston often carry flood zone designations that make traditional financing difficult. We pay cash and don't require mortgage approval, so flood zone status doesn't affect our ability to buy your home.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Can you buy my house in West Pittston or Dupont?`
- answer: `Yes. We buy throughout the Greater Pittston area — Pittston Borough, West Pittston, Dupont, Hughestown, Avoca, Jenkins Township, and all surrounding communities in Luzerne County.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `My Pittston house has foundation settling from mining activity. Can you buy it?`
- answer: `Yes. Mine subsidence and foundation settling are common in the Greater Pittston area due to the region's coal mining history. We buy these properties as-is and factor the structural repair costs into our offer. You don't need engineering reports or repair estimates — we handle all of that.`

```

**Field: `heroSubheadline`**
```
Kingston is a residential borough with strong community character — but an aging housing stock that creates challenges for homeowners who need to sell quickly. Inherited properties, estate sales, and homes needing major updates are common. ClearEdge buys Kingston homes as-is for cash.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Kingston sits directly across the Susquehanna River from Wilkes-Barre, and the borough's residential character attracts families and long-term residents. But that stability also means many homes haven't been significantly updated in decades. When these properties change hands — often through inheritance after a long-time owner passes — the new owners face homes with outdated electrical, aging roofs, and deferred maintenance that can cost $20,000–$40,000+ to address before listing.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Inherited properties are one of the most common reasons Kingston homeowners call ClearEdge. The borough's established, older population means estate sales happen frequently. If you've inherited a Kingston home that needs work, is full of belongings, or is simply a property you don't want to manage from a distance, ClearEdge can make a fair cash offer and handle everything — from the probate coordination to the cleanout.
```

**Field: `neighborhoods`**
```
["Kingston Borough", "Forty Fort", "Swoyersville", "Edwardsville", "Pringle", "Luzerne Borough", "Dallas"]
```

**Field: `faqs`** (3 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Why are inherited properties so common in Kingston?`
- answer: `Kingston is an established residential borough where many homeowners have lived for decades. When these long-term owners pass, their children — who often live out of the area — inherit homes that need significant updates. ClearEdge specializes in buying these inherited properties as-is, including the contents.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Does ClearEdge serve Forty Fort and nearby boroughs?`
- answer: `Yes. We buy throughout the Kingston area — including Forty Fort, Swoyersville, Edwardsville, Pringle, Luzerne Borough, Dallas, and all surrounding Luzerne County communities.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `How does selling to ClearEdge work for a Kingston estate sale?`
- answer: `After the executor has legal authority (Letters Testamentary from Luzerne County Register of Wills), we can close in as little as 14 days. We buy the home as-is — leave all furniture, personal items, and belongings. We handle the complete cleanout after closing at no cost to the estate.`

Nanticoke's affordable housing stock comes with a catch — most homes need substantial renovation to attract traditional buyers. ClearEdge buys Nanticoke homes in any condition for cash. No repairs, no waiting, no fees.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Nanticoke is a former coal town in Luzerne County with some of the most affordable housing in the Wyoming Valley. But affordable price tags often mask expensive problems — homes built in the early 1900s with outdated wiring, failing plumbing, foundation issues, and decades of deferred maintenance. The gap between what these homes cost and what they need in repairs creates a difficult equation for sellers: spending $20,000+ to renovate a home that might sell for $60,000–$80,000 doesn't make financial sense.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
ClearEdge has purchased multiple properties in Nanticoke and the surrounding Lower Luzerne County area. We buy homes where the repair costs would exceed the value gained from renovating — the properties that traditional agents struggle to sell because the numbers don't work for traditional buyers. If you own a Nanticoke home that needs more work than it's worth, a cash sale is often the most practical path forward.
```

```

**Field: `faqs`** (3 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Is it worth renovating my Nanticoke house before selling?`
- answer: `In most cases, no. Nanticoke's median home values mean that spending $20,000–$30,000 on renovations won't be fully recouped in the sale price. A cash sale lets you avoid the upfront expense and sell the home as-is. Tyler can give you an honest assessment of whether renovating or selling as-is makes more financial sense.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy multi-family properties in Nanticoke?`
- answer: `Yes. Nanticoke has many converted duplexes and multi-family properties from the coal era. We buy them with or without tenants, in any condition.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `How much can I expect for my Nanticoke house?`
- answer: `Our offers are based on the property's current condition, needed repairs, and comparable recent sales in the area. Nanticoke's lower price points mean our offers reflect local market values — but we're transparent about our calculations and happy to explain exactly how we arrived at the number.`

Carbondale sits at the northern end of Lackawanna County where rural character meets aging infrastructure. If your home needs work you can't justify financially, ClearEdge buys Carbondale properties as-is for cash — no repairs, no fees, fair offer in 24 hours.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Carbondale is the "Pioneer City" — home to the first railroad in Pennsylvania — but that history also means many homes are 100–150+ years old. Northern Lackawanna County's rural character and distance from the Scranton metro area keep property values lower, which makes expensive renovations even harder to justify. When a roof replacement costs $10,000 on a home worth $50,000–$70,000, the traditional listing math doesn't add up.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Many Carbondale homeowners contact ClearEdge because they've inherited a property from a family member who lived there for decades, or because they own a rental that's become more trouble than income. The combination of lower property values and high repair costs creates situations where a cash sale is often the most practical option — especially for out-of-area owners who can't manage repairs remotely.

FAQ 1:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy houses in northern Lackawanna County?`
- answer: `Yes. We buy throughout the Carbondale area — Carbondale Borough, Mayfield, Jermyn, Archbald, Scott Township, Fell Township, Simpson, and all surrounding communities. Northern Lackawanna County is part of our core NEPA service area.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Are Carbondale home values too low for a cash sale to make sense?`
- answer: `Not at all. Lower property values actually make cash sales MORE attractive — because the cost of repairing, listing, and paying commissions on a lower-value home eats up a larger percentage of the sale price. For many Carbondale properties, selling as-is to ClearEdge puts more money in your pocket than the traditional route.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `I inherited a house in Carbondale but live out of state. Can you help?`
- answer: `Yes — remote sales are common for us. Tyler handles the walkthrough, coordinates with the title company, and arranges mobile notary for your signing. You never need to visit the property. We also handle the complete cleanout after closing at no cost.`

**Field: `heroSubheadline`**

Dunmore is one of Scranton's most established suburbs — but established neighborhoods mean aging homes that need updates. Whether you're dealing with deferred maintenance, an inherited property, or a house you simply want to sell without the hassle, ClearEdge makes fair cash offers in 24 hours.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Dunmore borders Scranton to the east and has long been considered one of the area's more desirable suburbs. But desirable doesn't mean maintenance-free. Many Dunmore homes were built in the 1940s–1960s, and after 60–80 years, they need significant updates — from electrical panels and plumbing to roofs and windows. Homeowners who've lived in their Dunmore homes for decades may have deferred maintenance that has accumulated into a substantial repair bill.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
For families inheriting Dunmore properties or homeowners who simply can't justify spending $15,000–$30,000 on pre-sale repairs, ClearEdge offers a direct alternative. We've bought multiple homes in Dunmore Borough and understand the local market values across the community — from homes near Sherwood Park to properties along Main Avenue. Fair cash offer in 24 hours, close on your timeline.

- question: `Does ClearEdge buy homes in Dunmore's established neighborhoods?`
- answer: `Yes. We buy throughout Dunmore Borough and surrounding communities including Throop, Dickson City, Blakely, and Olyphant. Whether your home is well-maintained or needs significant work, we'll make a fair offer based on its current condition.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `My parents' Dunmore house needs a lot of work. Should I fix it or sell as-is?`
- answer: `For most inherited Dunmore properties, selling as-is is the smarter financial move. The cost of renovating an older home ($15,000–$30,000+) plus 5–6% agent commissions and 90+ days on market often nets you a similar amount to a direct cash sale — without the time, stress, and out-of-pocket expense.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `How does ClearEdge's offer compare to listing with an agent in Dunmore?`
- answer: `Our offer reflects the property's as-is value — typically lower than what an agent might list it for after repairs. But when you subtract repair costs ($15K–$30K), agent commission (5–6%), closing costs (2–4%), and carrying costs during the 90+ day listing period, the net proceeds are often comparable. Tyler will show you the math for your specific property.`

```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Honesdale is the seat of Wayne County and the gateway between NEPA and the Poconos. The borough features charming Victorian-era homes and historic properties — but charm doesn't pay for new roofs, updated wiring, or foundation repairs. Many Honesdale homes are 80–130 years old and need significant investment to meet modern standards. The rural location and lower population density also mean a smaller buyer pool, which translates to longer listing times for properties that aren't move-in ready.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Wayne County also sees a high volume of inherited properties and estate sales, as long-time residents pass homes to family members who often live in other parts of the state or out of state entirely. Managing a property sale from a distance — especially one that needs repairs — is expensive and time-consuming. ClearEdge buys Honesdale and Wayne County properties in any condition, handles everything remotely if needed, and can close within 14–30 days.

FAQ 2:
- question: `My Honesdale property is very old — built in the 1800s. Do you still buy it?`
- answer: `Absolutely. We specialize in older properties across Eastern PA. Victorian-era homes often have structural, electrical, and plumbing issues that make traditional sales difficult. We buy them as-is and handle all updates after closing.`

FAQ 3:

Bloomsburg is Pennsylvania's only incorporated town, home to a university, and full of investment properties and older homes. Whether you're a landlord ready to exit or inherited a property in Columbia County, ClearEdge buys Bloomsburg houses as-is for cash.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Bloomsburg's identity as a college town means a significant portion of the housing stock has been converted to rental properties over the decades. Many of these rentals are older homes that have seen heavy tenant use and deferred maintenance. Landlords who are ready to exit the rental business face a challenging prospect: their properties often need $15,000–$30,000+ in repairs to attract traditional buyers, and the college-town rental market makes the repair economics even trickier.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Bloomsburg also experienced devastating flooding in 2011 and has ongoing flood risk along Fishing Creek. Properties with flood history face higher insurance costs and a limited traditional buyer pool.

FAQ 2:
- question: `Can you buy a Bloomsburg property with flood history?`
- answer: `Yes. Bloomsburg's flood risk from Fishing Creek makes traditional sales challenging for affected properties. We pay cash and don't require mortgage approval, so flood history doesn't prevent us from purchasing.`

Allentown is the Lehigh Valley's largest city — but between the 2.5% transfer tax, mandatory pre-sale inspections, and aging housing stock, selling traditionally here is expensive. ClearEdge buys Allentown houses as-is for cash. We cover the transfer tax, skip the inspections, and close in as few as 7 days.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 3 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Allentown presents a unique challenge for sellers: the city has one of the highest transfer taxes in Pennsylvania at 2.5% (as of 2026). On a $200,000 home, that's $5,000 in transfer tax alone — on top of the 5–6% agent commission, 2–4% closing costs, and whatever you spend on repairs. For a seller doing the math, the traditional route can cost $25,000–$40,000 before you see a dollar. ClearEdge absorbs the transfer tax as part of our purchase — you pay nothing at closing.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Allentown's housing stock is diverse — from downtown row homes in Center City and the Old Allentown Historic District to single-families in the West End and South Allentown. Many of these homes are 80–100 years old and need electrical updates, plumbing replacement, roof work, or foundation repairs. The city's code enforcement has also increased, with more aggressive inspection programs that catch deferred maintenance and issue violations with escalating fines.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
Whether you're in Center City dealing with code violations, in the West End with an inherited property, or in South Allentown with a rental that's more trouble than income, ClearEdge can make you a fair cash offer within 24 hours.

**Field: `faqs`** (5 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `How does Allentown's 2.5% transfer tax affect selling my house?`
- answer: `Allentown's transfer tax is among the highest in PA — on a $200,000 home, that's $5,000. When selling to ClearEdge, we cover this cost. It's included in our offer calculation, so the cash offer you accept is the amount you receive at closing. No hidden transfer tax deduction.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Does Allentown require inspections before selling a house?`
- answer: `Allentown has increased its property inspection program, and certain sales trigger mandatory inspections. When selling to ClearEdge, these inspections don't delay or prevent the sale — we buy as-is regardless of what an inspection might find, and we handle any compliance requirements after closing.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `What Allentown neighborhoods does ClearEdge buy in?`
- answer: `Every one. Center City, West End, South Allentown, East Side, Old Allentown Historic District, Midway Manor, West Park, Irving Park, Lehigh Parkway, Jordan Heights, Fountain Hill, and all surrounding areas. No neighborhood is off-limits.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `Can you buy my Allentown house with code violations?`
- answer: `Yes. Allentown's code enforcement has intensified in recent years. We buy properties with open violations regularly — the violations transfer to us at closing, and we handle compliance. This stops the daily fines from accumulating on your property.`

FAQ 5:
- question: `I inherited a house in Allentown. What are the tax implications?`
- answer: `Pennsylvania inheritance tax applies: 0% for surviving spouses, 4.5% for direct descendants, 12% for siblings, 15% for others. The inheritance tax is separate from the sale — you'll owe it regardless of whether you sell or keep the property. Selling to ClearEdge for cash can provide the funds to pay the inheritance tax while also eliminating the ongoing carrying costs of the property.`

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 3 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Bethlehem straddles Lehigh and Northampton counties and is one of the Lehigh Valley's most desirable communities. The South Side's historic district, the revitalized SteelStacks area, and established neighborhoods like Fountain Hill and West Bethlehem attract strong buyer interest. But Bethlehem's desirability comes with a catch: the housing stock is old. Many homes on the South Side date to the 1800s, and even "newer" neighborhoods feature homes from the 1940s–1960s.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Old homes mean expensive problems. Stone foundations that have been settling for a century, outdated electrical systems that no insurer wants to cover, galvanized plumbing that's corroded from the inside, and lead paint that requires certified abatement. For homeowners who've lived in their Bethlehem home for decades and deferred maintenance, the bill to get the house "list-ready" can exceed $30,000–$50,000. That's a significant investment with no guaranteed return.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
Bethlehem also enforces the International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC) under Article 1733, with escalating daily fines for violations. For properties with multiple code issues, the fines can accumulate faster than the owner can afford to fix them. ClearEdge buys Bethlehem properties with code violations, structural issues, and deferred maintenance — we handle all compliance and repairs after closing.

**Field: `faqs`** (4 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy historic homes in Bethlehem's South Side?`
- answer: `Yes. Historic South Side homes often have charm but also expensive structural, electrical, and plumbing issues. We buy them as-is — no requirement to bring them up to modern code before selling. We handle all renovations after closing.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `What about Bethlehem's IPMC code enforcement?`
- answer: `Bethlehem enforces the International Property Maintenance Code (Article 1733) with daily fines that escalate for unresolved violations. We buy properties with open IPMC violations regularly — the violations transfer to us at closing and you're released from all obligations.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `I inherited a Bethlehem property with significant issues. Can you help?`
- answer: `Yes — inherited properties in Bethlehem are one of our most common purchase types. We buy the home exactly as-is, including contents. No cleanout, no repairs, no dealing with contractors. We can close during or after probate and work directly with your estate attorney.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy in both Lehigh and Northampton County sides of Bethlehem?`
- answer: `Yes. Bethlehem spans both counties, and we buy throughout — including Fountain Hill, Freemansburg, Hanover Township, Lower Saucon, and all surrounding areas on both sides of the city line.`

Easton's downtown is revitalizing, but many surrounding neighborhoods have older homes with deferred maintenance that the traditional market overlooks. ClearEdge buys Easton houses in any condition — no repairs, no fees, fair cash offer in 24 hours.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Easton sits at the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers in Northampton County, and the city's downtown revitalization has attracted new restaurants, businesses, and interest. But step outside the downtown core into neighborhoods like West Ward, South Side, and parts of College Hill, and the housing stock tells a different story. Many homes are 80–120 years old with deferred maintenance, outdated systems, and repair needs that make traditional sales difficult and expensive.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Easton also has a ward-based rental inspection program on a 4-year cycle, which creates additional compliance requirements for landlords. For property owners looking to exit the rental market or sell a home that needs more work than it's worth, ClearEdge offers a direct path. We buy throughout Easton and surrounding Northampton County communities — including properties with code violations, tenant issues, and deferred maintenance.
```

**Field: `neighborhoods`**
```
["Downtown Easton", "West Ward", "South Side", "College Hill", "Palmer Township", "Forks Township", "Wilson Borough", "West Easton"]
```

**Field: `faqs`** (3 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy houses in Easton's older neighborhoods?`
- answer: `Yes — West Ward, South Side, and College Hill are areas where we frequently purchase homes. These neighborhoods have older housing stock with deferred maintenance that traditional buyers often avoid. We buy in any condition, as-is.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `I'm a landlord in Easton dealing with rental inspections. Can you buy my rental?`
- answer: `Yes. Easton's ward-based rental inspection program can be burdensome for landlords with properties that need work. We buy rental properties with or without tenants — no need to pass inspections or make repairs before selling to us.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `How fast can you close on an Easton property?`
- answer: `We can close in as little as 7 days when the title is clear. Most Easton transactions close within 14–21 days. We work with local Northampton County title companies who know the area and can process quickly.`

Reading has some of the most affordable housing in Eastern PA — but low price points and high repair costs create a difficult equation for sellers. ClearEdge buys Reading houses in any condition for cash. No repairs, no fees, no waiting.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 3 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Reading is the Berks County seat and one of Eastern Pennsylvania's most affordable housing markets. But affordable home prices mask a challenge for sellers: the cost of repairs often represents a significant percentage of the home's total value. When a home is worth $60,000–$100,000 and needs $15,000–$25,000 in work, spending money on repairs before listing doesn't make financial sense. Traditional buyers who want turnkey homes have plenty of options in the market — properties that need work get overlooked.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Reading's code enforcement program has also become more aggressive, with the city's I-30 quality-of-life ordinance and property maintenance codes carrying escalating fines. Row homes and multi-family properties — which make up a large portion of Reading's housing stock — are particularly vulnerable to violations because of shared walls, aging common infrastructure, and years of deferred maintenance.
```

Paragraph 3:
```
ClearEdge buys properties throughout Reading and Berks County — row homes, single-families, duplexes, and properties with code violations or tax liens. Berks County's judicial tax sale process creates urgency for homeowners with delinquent taxes, and we can often close fast enough to prevent the sale. If you own a Reading property that the traditional market has left behind, Tyler can give you a fair cash offer within 24 hours.
```

```

**Field: `faqs`** (4 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Can you buy my Reading house with a tax lien?`
- answer: `Yes. Berks County tax liens get paid from the sale proceeds at closing — you don't need to pay them before selling. We can often close fast enough to prevent a scheduled judicial tax sale. Contact Tyler immediately if your property has a sale date approaching.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy row homes in Reading?`
- answer: `Yes. Row homes are the most common property type we buy in Reading. Shared walls, aging infrastructure, and deferred maintenance are challenges we handle every day. We buy row homes in any condition, as-is.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `What about Reading's code enforcement and I-30 violations?`
- answer: `We buy properties with open code violations and I-30 quality-of-life violations in Reading regularly. The violations transfer to us at closing and you're released from all obligations, including accumulated fines.`

FAQ 4:
- question: `Is it worth listing my Reading house with an agent?`
- answer: `It depends on your property's condition. If it's move-in ready, an agent may net you more. But if your Reading home needs $15,000+ in repairs, factor in the repair cost, 5–6% commission, 2–4% closing costs, and 90+ days of carrying costs. For many Reading properties, a cash sale nets comparable proceeds without the upfront expense and wait.`

**Field: `metaDescription`**

```

**Field: `heroSubheadline`**
```
Pottsville is the heart of Schuylkill County's Coal Region — and coal-era housing comes with coal-era challenges. ClearEdge buys Pottsville houses in any condition for cash. No repairs, no mine subsidence worries, no fees.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Pottsville is the Schuylkill County seat and the hub of Pennsylvania's Coal Region. The city's housing stock dates primarily to the late 1800s and early 1900s, built for coal industry workers. These homes have character — but they also have coal-era problems: mine subsidence risk, stone foundations with over a century of settling, lead paint, asbestos, and infrastructure that predates modern building codes. Traditional buyers struggle to get financing on many Coal Region properties because of these issues.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Schuylkill County's lower property values make the repair-versus-value equation particularly challenging. Spending $20,000 on repairs for a home worth $50,000–$70,000 is a losing proposition. ClearEdge buys Coal Region properties in any condition — we understand the region's unique challenges and factor them into fair offers based on actual local market values, not inflated estimates.
```

**Field: `neighborhoods`**

["Pottsville City", "Minersville", "Saint Clair", "Port Carbon", "Schuylkill Haven", "Tamaqua", "Shenandoah", "Mahanoy City", "Ashland"]
```

**Field: `faqs`** (3 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy houses in the broader Coal Region beyond Pottsville?`
- answer: `Yes. We serve Pottsville, Minersville, Saint Clair, Port Carbon, Schuylkill Haven, Tamaqua, Shenandoah, Mahanoy City, Ashland, and surrounding Schuylkill County communities. The entire Coal Region is within our service area.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Are Coal Region home values too low for a cash sale?`
- answer: `Not at all. Lower property values actually make cash sales MORE practical because the traditional selling costs (repairs, commissions, closing costs) represent a larger percentage of the sale price. For many Coal Region properties, a cash sale puts more money in your pocket than the traditional route.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `Can you buy a Pottsville property with mine subsidence issues?`
- answer: `Yes. Mine subsidence is a documented reality across Schuylkill County, and most mortgage lenders won't finance affected properties. ClearEdge pays cash, so there's no lender to deny the deal. We factor subsidence repair costs into our offer and buy as-is.`

Stroudsburg is the Poconos' main commercial hub — and Monroe County's unique mix of residential homes, vacation properties, and investment rentals creates selling challenges the traditional market can't always solve. ClearEdge buys Stroudsburg properties as-is for cash.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Stroudsburg serves as the commercial and residential center of the Poconos region. The borough has a diverse housing stock — from historic homes along Main Street to suburban developments in surrounding Stroud Township and Pocono Township. But Monroe County's vacation-home market dynamics affect even residential properties: seasonal demand fluctuations, a higher-than-average percentage of investor-owned homes, and STR regulation changes have created uncertainty for property owners trying to sell.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
For Stroudsburg homeowners dealing with properties that need work, the traditional market offers limited solutions. Monroe County's GovOS/MCOCA system tracks short-term rental compliance, adding regulatory burden for investment property owners. ClearEdge buys residential homes, former vacation rentals, and investment properties throughout the Stroudsburg area — in any condition, with any regulatory status.
```

**Field: `faqs`** (3 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy houses in the Greater Stroudsburg area?`
- answer: `Yes. We buy throughout Stroudsburg Borough, Stroud Township, Pocono Township, Smithfield Township, Delaware Water Gap, Marshalls Creek, Bartonsville, and all surrounding Monroe County communities.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Can you buy my Stroudsburg property that was an Airbnb?`
- answer: `Yes. Whether your STR is compliant, non-compliant, or you've stopped renting entirely, we buy former vacation rental properties. Monroe County's GovOS tracking and STR regulations don't affect our ability to purchase.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `How does the Pocono vacation market affect Stroudsburg home sales?`
- answer: `Seasonal demand means most Pocono buyers shop spring through summer, creating 4–6 month dead periods for traditional listings. ClearEdge buys year-round — we don't wait for seasonal demand. Whether it's January or July, we can make an offer and close on your timeline.`

```
East Stroudsburg is a university town with a mix of student rentals, investment properties, and older homes that need updating. Whether you're a tired landlord, inherited a property, or need to sell fast, ClearEdge buys East Stroudsburg homes as-is for cash.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
East Stroudsburg's identity as a university town shapes its housing market. East Stroudsburg University drives demand for student housing, which means many residential properties have been converted to rentals over the years. These properties see heavy use and often have significant wear and tear — damaged walls, worn flooring, outdated kitchens and bathrooms, and deferred maintenance that accumulates over years of student tenancy. Landlords who are ready to exit face the cost of restoring these properties to attract traditional buyers.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Beyond the university market, East Stroudsburg has an older housing stock with the same challenges found throughout the Poconos: septic systems instead of municipal sewer, well water, and homes built for seasonal use that weren't designed for year-round living. ClearEdge buys all types of East Stroudsburg properties — student rentals, primary residences, and vacation homes — in any condition. No repairs, no tenant eviction, no septic or well remediation needed before selling.
```

```

**Field: `faqs`** (3 objects)

FAQ 1:
- question: `Does ClearEdge buy student rental properties in East Stroudsburg?`
- answer: `Yes. Student rental properties often have significant wear and tear from years of tenant use. We buy them as-is — no repairs, no cleanout, no need to evict tenants before selling. We've purchased multiple former student rentals in the ESU area.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Can you buy my East Stroudsburg house if it has septic issues?`
- answer: `Yes. Septic system failures are common in the East Stroudsburg area and can cost $15,000–$30,000 to replace — a deal-killer for traditional buyers. We factor septic repair costs into our offer and buy as-is. No remediation needed before selling.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `I own a rental near ESU but live out of state. Can you handle everything?`
- answer: `Absolutely. Out-of-state landlords are one of our most common seller profiles. Tyler handles the property walkthrough, tenant communication, title company coordination, and closing logistics. You can sign documents remotely through a mobile notary.`

Pocono Pines is a lake community area with vacation homes, A-frames, and HOA properties that face unique selling challenges. If your Pocono Pines home isn't producing the returns it once did — or has become a financial burden — ClearEdge buys it as-is for cash.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Pocono Pines is centered around the lake communities of Tobyhanna Township, including Lake Naomi, Pinecrest Lake, and surrounding developments. These communities feature vacation homes, A-frames, and HOA properties that were built primarily as second homes. Selling in this market faces specific challenges: seasonal buyer demand (most shoppers look spring through summer), HOA transfer requirements and fees, second-home mortgage restrictions (10–20% down required), and property-specific issues like aging septic systems, well water, and winterization damage.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
Many Pocono Pines property owners purchased during the pandemic boom expecting strong Airbnb returns. With bookings declining and some communities restricting short-term rentals, these properties have become financial burdens — costing more in HOA fees, insurance, maintenance, and taxes than they generate in income. ClearEdge buys vacation homes, underperforming STRs, and properties in HOA communities. We handle HOA transfer requirements, pay any transfer fees, and close on your timeline.

- question: `Does ClearEdge buy vacation homes in Pocono Pines HOA communities?`
- answer: `Yes. We regularly buy properties in HOA communities like Lake Naomi and Pinecrest Lake. We handle all HOA transfer requirements, pay any transfer fees, and work directly with the association. HOA restrictions don't prevent us from purchasing.`

FAQ 2:
- question: `Can you buy my Pocono Pines A-frame or cabin?`
- answer: `Yes. A-frames, cabins, and non-traditional structures are common in the Pocono Pines area. Aging A-frames often have roof issues, insulation problems, and structural concerns that scare off traditional buyers. We buy them as-is.`

FAQ 3:
- question: `My Pocono Pines Airbnb isn't producing income anymore. Can you buy it?`
- answer: `Yes — underperforming vacation rentals are one of the most common reasons Pocono Pines owners call us. If your property costs more in HOA fees, insurance, and maintenance than it generates in bookings, a cash sale lets you exit quickly without waiting for seasonal demand to return.`

Tannersville's resort-adjacent location means seasonal demand, ski-chalet maintenance headaches, and a buyer pool that's pickier than most. ClearEdge buys Tannersville properties year-round — no seasonal waiting, no repairs, no buyer financing to fall through.
```

**Field: `problemStatement`** (PortableText — 2 paragraphs)

Paragraph 1:
```
Tannersville sits near Camelback Resort and the heart of the Pocono Mountains' ski and recreation corridor. The area features ski chalets, resort-adjacent condos, and seasonal properties built primarily for vacation use. These properties face unique selling challenges: demand is heavily seasonal (peaking in ski season and summer), maintenance costs are high due to weather exposure, and many properties were built or renovated for short-term rental use that may no longer comply with evolving township regulations.
```

Paragraph 2:
```
For Tannersville property owners who are tired of paying for a property they rarely use, dealing with seasonal maintenance, or sitting on an Airbnb that's no longer profitable, ClearEdge provides a year-round exit. We buy ski chalets, resort condos, seasonal properties, and standard residential homes throughout the Tannersville and Pocono Township area. No seasonal timing required — we buy in January as readily as July.
