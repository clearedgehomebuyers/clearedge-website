## Frequently Asked Questions

### About Our Offers

**How do you determine your offer price?**
We analyze recent sales of similar homes in your area, assess the current condition of your property, estimate repair costs, and factor in current market conditions. Our offers reflect fair market value minus necessary repairs and our costs. We're always transparent about how we calculate our offers.

**Are your offers negotiable?**
We make our best fair offer upfront, but we're always willing to discuss. If you have concerns about our offer, let's talk. We want to reach a price that works for both of us.

**Do you make lowball offers?**
No. We make fair offers based on the property's true condition and market value. We're not interested in taking advantage of anyone - we want to help homeowners while running a sustainable business.

**Will you match what a real estate agent says my home is worth?**
Probably not, and here's why: agent estimates assume you'll make repairs, stage the home, and wait months for the right buyer. Our offers reflect buying as-is, today, with no contingencies. The trade-off is speed, certainty, and convenience versus maximum price.

**How quickly will I get an offer?**
Within 24 hours of contacting us. Often the same day.

**Is there any cost to get an offer?**
No. Our offers are 100% free with no obligation. You can get an offer and decide later.

### About the Process

**How fast can you close?**
As fast as 7 days if you need to move quickly. We can also close in 14, 30, 60, or 90+ days - whatever works for your situation.

**Who handles the paperwork?**
We coordinate everything with a reputable local title company. They handle the title search, prepare documents, and facilitate the closing. We make it easy.

**Do I need to be present at closing?**
Typically yes, but we can arrange remote closings if you've relocated or can't attend in person.

**What happens on closing day?**
You sign the paperwork at the title company, hand over the keys, and receive your payment (certified check or wire transfer). The whole process usually takes about an hour.

**Can I stay in the home after closing?**
In some cases, yes. We can arrange a rent-back or delayed move-out if you need extra time. Just let us know your situation.

### About Property Condition

**Do I need to make any repairs?**
No. We buy houses in any condition. Don't spend money on repairs before selling to us.

**What if my house is really bad?**
We've bought houses in every condition imaginable - fire damage, hoarder situations, foundation failures, mold, you name it. Show us the property and we'll make an offer.

**Do I need to clean out the house?**
No. Leave anything you don't want - furniture, appliances, junk, personal items. We handle all cleanouts at no cost to you.

**What if there are code violations?**
We buy homes with code violations, open permits, and even condemned properties. These don't scare us.

**Do you buy homes with structural issues?**
Yes. Foundation cracks, settling, bowing walls - we buy them all.

### About Fees & Costs

**Do you charge any fees?**
No. We never charge fees to sellers. Our profit comes from renovating and reselling the home, not from fees.

**Who pays closing costs?**
We pay typical seller closing costs. You walk away with the offer amount (minus any mortgage payoff).

**Do I have to pay agent commissions?**
No. We are not agents - we're the actual buyers. There are no commissions when selling to us.

**Are there any hidden costs?**
None. The offer we make is what you receive (minus your mortgage payoff if applicable).

### About Our Company

**Do you have references?**
Yes. We can provide references from past sellers, and you can read our Google reviews online.

**What do you do with the houses you buy?**
We typically renovate and resell them to homeowners or hold them as rentals. We're improving neighborhoods and providing housing.

### Specific Situations

**Can you help if I'm in foreclosure?**
Yes. We specialize in helping homeowners avoid foreclosure. We can often close before the sheriff sale, helping you protect your credit and move on with dignity.
